Protocols for better conversations in life and work

The experience of the global response to Covid-19 was for many people a lonely and isolation experience. We were confined indoors

Always and everywhere on Earth, people have common needs. They want to matter, the want to be listened to, they want to feel a connection to other people, to nature, and to some bigger meaning.

### Why:
* The enjoyment of shared curiosity
* Exploring ideas together
* Learning together
* Create authentic connections to one-another
* Fastidious pursuit of the truth
* Interactions, connection, learning, exploration, curiosity...
* Lost Connections (Johan Hari) 

### How
* Always begin with definitions
* Periodic emotional check-ins
* Vulnerability
* Earnest intent
* Deep challenging thought
* Unhurried - no interruptions
* Self-honesty
* Psychological Safe
* Steel Man
* Embrace difficult subjects
* Give the benefit of the doubt
* Avoid mental gymnastics
* Non-judgemental
* Convince, don't coerce
* Nuanced thinking - avoid black and white thinking.
* System thinking
* The Map is not the Territory
* Beware our Biases
* Truth Seeking
* Use of Tools and Models
* Bring Wisdom to Interactions
* Optimised curiosity
* Challenge accepted wisdom
* Polite dissent
* Avoidance of groupthink
* Atuned and aware to cognitive bias
* Empathetic to differences in moral tastebuds
* Adult to adult
* Avoidance of the drama triangle
* Dialectic synthesis
* Good faith vs bad faith
* Constructive arguments
* Unhurried
* Conscious conversations
* Egoless - letting go of your ego - stop trying to seem 'smart'
* Blameless
* Awarene of our conversational styles/patterns we get stuck in - break free
* Consider that the other person might be going through a personal hell - weithout showing it
* The connection matters more than the content. The content flows through the connection (Daniel Schmachtenberger)
* Don't damage connections in the pursuit of being right on a certain issue
* Consider the Backfire effect - pushing your agneda onto others often hardens their own beliefs. 
* Don't make your point at the expense of the relaionship, or the tone of the conversation
* Beware of virtue signalling your allegience to a group
* Are you just here to receive personal validation, to boost your ego or self-worth?
* Are you treating this as a popularity contest?
* Space and time to talk, unhurriedly, and be listened to.
* Active listening
* Oftentimes people have very real tacit knowledge or lived experience that is meaningful but that they might not know how to articulate clearly (Schmachtenberger)
* Consideration of differences in people's moral tastebuds (Johnathan Haidt)
* Avoid defensiveness
* Avoid causing defensiveness by exagerating emotions, criticising, judging, shaming or blaming
* If you disagree, don't dismiss, look for the grains of truth, don't invalidate people's lived experiences
* Seek first to understand
* Ask earnest questions
* Offer a synopsis to see if you have understood someone's position correctly
* Are you disagreeing about made up things - check assumptions, check th propositions of an argument.
* Make well constructed logical arguments (See Molyneux 'The art of argument')
* Steel-manning opposing positions before offering critique - bolster and argue their position as strongly as you can
* Understand the influence of context and mindset. Set and Setting.
* Give the benefit of the doubt, even when a position sounds utterly stupid, find perspective, find the grain of truth
* "I think I might have misunderstood because it sounded like you said X and I imagine that might not be what you actually meant." (Schmachtenberger)
* Acknowledge what you do agree or resonate with in their position before addressing where there are differences (Schmachtenberger)
* Develop a 'win and help win' attitude, not winner takes all
* Game B vs Game A - avoid game theoretic brinkmanship
* Apply MRI - Most Respectful Interpretation
* Don't get frustrated by people who can't understand something, or can't articulate something.  Help them.
* Embrace diversity, go beyond the obvious such as skin colour, sexuality or gender - consider neurodiversity, diversity of opinion, diversity of capability. Use diversity to take the conversation into unexpected areas.
* Avoid generalisations
* Open-mindedness vs narrow-mindedness
* Don't conflate ignorance with malice - everyone's backstory is different - bring people into the light, don't judge their lack of opportunity to know
* Be mindful and show compassion
* Accept our human fallability - preserve our ignorance, indignity, incomprehension, and general cluelessness - keep humble.
* Practice Deep Listening - think about what is at stake for the other person, try to understand what matters to them, not what I think matters.
* Have an open mind to possibility, comfort with the unknown and the ambiguous.
